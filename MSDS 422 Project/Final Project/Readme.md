## **Executive Summary**
Customer data can be used to identify whether someone has exited, whether that means something like unsubscribing or moving to a different service. 
By using the Bank Customer Churn dataset we tuned four classification models to obtain the most accurate results when predicting customer “Exited” categories. 
Initial EDA revealed that 11 features were quantitative and 3 were qualitative. The data was clean with no null values in any of the columns. 
Plotting the correlations of the quantitative data revealed that balance and age had the strongest correlation to whether or not a customer exited whereas number of products and if the customer was active showed the least correlation.

## **To Do:**
Explain any other EDA we complete
Explain encoding if we do it for qualitative data
Feature engineering
List the models we use (can’t be done for the midpoint)
Explain the results (can’t be done for the midpoint)
Conclusion- what do we recommend (can’t be done for the midpoint)
