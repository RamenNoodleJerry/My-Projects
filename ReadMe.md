### **1. Boat Sales Analysis Project**
Nearly New Nautical is a website that allows users to advertise their used boats for sale. The marketing team is preparing a weekly newsletter for boat owners.

The newsletter is designed to help sellers to get more views of their boat, as well as stay on top of market trends. The Head of Marketing has laid out an ambitious goal
of increasing the number of readers by 75% this year. 

They would like you to take a look at the recent data and help them learn more about the characteristics of the most viewed boat listings in the last 7 days - is it the
most expensive boats that get the most views? Are there common features among the most viewed boats?

**Topic Covered:** Data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data visualization


### **2. Hackathon - Railway Train Prediction**
This problem statement is based on the Shinkansen Bullet Train in Japan, and passengers’ experience with that mode of travel.

The objective of this problem is to understand which parameters play an important role in swaying passenger feedback towards a positive scale. 
You are provided test data containing the travel data and the survey data of passengers. 
Both the test data and the train data are collected at the same time and belong to the same population.

**Topic Covered:** Data Cleaning, Classification, CNN Network, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data visualization


### **3. Home Loan Default Prediction**
This project build decision tree, logistic regression, and random forest models to predict risky clients and recommends features to consider when approving a loan.

Three questions will be answered:
• Should we approve clients based on the information they provided?
• What kinds of clients are likely to default on their loans?
• What are essential features to consider while approving a loan?

**Topic Covered:** Data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Data visualization


### **4. Geodata Project**
Using the Google Places API with a Database and Visualizing Data on Google Map.

In this project, we are using the Google geocoding API to clean up some user-entered geographic
locations of university names and then placing the data on a Google Map.

**Topic Covered:** Python Coding, SQL Query, API, Geodata, Google Map


### **5. Plotly Dash Projects**
Plotly_Basics -> creating plotly charts using plotly.graph_objects and plotly.express

Flight_Dashboard.py -> Create a Yearly Airline Performance Report Dashboard that takes airline data as input and create ploty charts and graphs.

**Topic Covered:** Plotly Dash, Data cleaning, Data visualization


### **6. Data_Analysis_Final_Assignment**
Using Webscrapping and Yahoo Finance API to extract Tesla and Gamestop stock data, and then display this data in grapsh.

**Topic Covered:** Webscrapping, API, Data cleaning, Data visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis


### **7.R_Project Stock Analysis**
This research use the daily Apple and its supplers’ stock prices from 2008 to 2018 (Where Apple stock starts to skyrocket)
- Investigate whether stock of the suppliers of Apple explain apple stock price.
- Run the regression of Apple stock price with its suppliers’ stock price to determine which suppliers are strongly correlated with Apple Stock. 
- Test the causal effect, and determine which specific stock’s price change is causing most change of Apple stock.
- Find the combo of suppliers stock that mostly explain Apple Stock price; 
- Make hedging strategy to hedge risk of Apple stock price fluctuation, and therefore making Apple stock as a source of dividend generation only security.
